# Application not ready until dependencies are verified available

topic for the question **Outgoing/southbound dependencies**.

In a container orchestration environment, such as Kubernetes, containers must include
all the dependencies needed to start up and run successfully (aligned with the 
Self-Containment Principle of container-based application design[1]). However many times the
application inside the container requires external dependencies, that they could
not be available.

An application on a container platform needs to accommodate for this and should be
able to automatically recover and act from any event with an impact on its
functionality. When an applicationâ€™s dependencies are not available, it needs to be
able to recover - otherwise it could introduce cascading failures in a Microservices
architecture where it is itself serving as a dependency to other services.

Generally speaking, applications should implement cloud-native patterns to manage
the availability of the dependencies. Samples of these patterns:

* Circuit Breaker pattern[2] to break cascading failures
* Retries policies 
* Readiness Probe[3] to signal a not-ready state, causing the container platform block any
incoming traffic to the container.
* Liveness Probe[3] to signal a failed state, causing the container platform to restart it.
