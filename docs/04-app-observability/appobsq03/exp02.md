# No health or readiness query functionality available

topic for the question **How easy is it to determine the application's health and readiness to handle traffic?**.

In a container orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes, containers will be
started and stopped based on a number of events, such as evacuating a worker
node for maintenance, rollout of a new configuration, etc.

To avoid service interruptions for the service consumer, Kubernetes will
continuously verify that a container is ready to receive traffic (readiness probe)
and is healthy (liveness probe)(i.e. not in a deadlocked state, etc).

How Kubernetes reacts on probe failure can be configured individually, however
as a prerequisite, these probes need to be implemented by the application. A good
example for a readiness probe is for example a HTTP “/health” endpoint that will
only return a valid status after all server components have been started and
initialized.

There are various options to implement this[1] and good practices around it[2].

While it is theoretically possible to run containers that do not implement
these probes, it is strongly recommended to provide the probe endpoint.
The implications of not having these in place are numerous, none of which
are desirable. Therefore, this finding has been marked as “High” in
the assessment report.
